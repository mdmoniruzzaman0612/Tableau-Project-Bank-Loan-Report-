ðŸš€ Optimizing Bank Loan Reporting with Data Analytics ðŸ“Š

Thrilled to share my latest project on Bank Loan Reporting, where we leveraged data-driven insights to enhance loan portfolio management!

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:
We developed a comprehensive Bank Loan Report that provides key performance metrics (KPIs) to track loan applications, funded amounts, repayment trends, and risk classification.

ðŸ”¹ Key Metrics & Insights:
âœ… Total Loan Applications â€“ Monthly and overall trends
âœ… Funded Amounts & Collections â€“ Monitoring cash flow
âœ… Interest Rate & Debt-to-Income Analysis â€“ Evaluating borrower affordability
âœ… Good vs. Bad Loan Classification â€“ Risk assessment for better decision-making
âœ… Loan Status & Geographic Analysis â€“ Understanding regional lending patterns

ðŸ”¹ Technology Used:
ðŸ“Œ SQL for querying large datasets
ðŸ“Œ Tableau for interactive dashboards
ðŸ“Œ Data modeling for loan risk assessment

This project empowers banks to make informed lending decisions, optimize risk strategies, and enhance customer portfolio management.
